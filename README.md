# Customer-Feedback-Analysis-Dashboard


## Problem Statement
Customer satisfaction is a critical determinant of business success in todayâ€™s competitive market. However, organizations often face challenges in understanding customer needs, preferences, and pain points. This lack of actionable insights can hinder the ability to improve products, services, and overall customer experience.

The primary issue addressed by this project is the need to identify key drivers of customer feedback and evaluate sales representatives' performance, product categories, and return statuses to optimize business strategies.


## Objectives

The main objectives of this dashboard are as follows:

1. To analyze customer feedback to identify key areas of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.

2. To assess the performance of sales representatives across various channels.

3. To evaluate product category performance to determine the most and least profitable segments.

4. To understand customer segmentation and its impact on sales.

5. To investigate return statuses and develop strategies to reduce product returns.

6. To provide actionable recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.
   

## Data Methods and Tools

The data used for this analysis was collected and cleaned using Microsoft Excel. Key steps included:

1. Removing duplicates to ensure data accuracy.

2. Standardizing column names and formats for consistency.

3. Handling missing values by imputing or removing incomplete records.

4. Validating data integrity for accuracy in analysis.

Power BI was used to design and develop the interactive dashboard. Key features of Power BI, such as DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and visuals, enabled effective representation of insights.
